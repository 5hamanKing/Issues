i have a issue. i invited someone to my guild. but because of a glitch or somehting. 
she got duplicated. this was doable on its onw. but she stopt playing. and now i wanna kick her form the guild cus its taking space. 
but i cant cus shes in there twice. and therefor also takes up twice the space.
so now is the question. what do i do?
( the guild this is about is Funbari Onsen, the duplicated member is KawaiiAshley)

waiting for help. with kind regards. 5haman.
